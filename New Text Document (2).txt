This project creates a virtual reality environment for emergency evacuation scenarios, such as fire mishaps, bomb explosions, and natural disasters. The project is novel because it offers a secure and controlled setting for emergency preparedness training. The virtual reality setting displays a faithful representation of a building with various rooms, hallways, stairs, and exits. People who need training for emergency situations, such as firefighters, security personnel, and building managers, are the application's main target audience. To prepare people for actual emergency situations, we set out to develop a practical tool. The application simulates an emergency and directs the user to a safe exit from the building. This application is beneficial because it can offer a secure and affordable training tool that can assist people in getting ready for emergencies.
